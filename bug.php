In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["a"] = 1;
$myArray["b"] = 2;
echo $myArray["c"]; // Notice the undefined key "c"
```

PHP, unlike some other languages, will not throw an error if you try to access an undefined array key. Instead, it will silently return NULL. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug problems, especially in larger applications where the cause of a NULL value may be far removed from where it is used.  The lack of an explicit error makes this harder to detect.

Another related issue occurs with type juggling. PHP's loose typing can lead to unexpected results if you are not careful about how you are using and comparing values. For example, if you are checking for the existence of a key using `isset()`, be aware that `isset()` will return `false` for keys that have been set to `NULL`.

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["d"] = NULL;
if (!isset($myArray["d"])) {
    echo "Key 'd' is not set"; //This will not execute, even though the value is NULL 
} else {
  echo "Key 'd' is set"; //This executes
}
```

These silent failures can create insidious bugs that are difficult to track down.  Robust error handling and explicit key checks are essential to avoid these issues.
